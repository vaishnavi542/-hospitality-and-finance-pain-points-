Implemented Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to enhance data privacy and access control in permissioned blockchain networks.
Developed a secure and decentralized system for data transactions, reducing the dependency on traditional key distribution methods.
Utilized cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and tamper resistance in blockchain environments.
Designed an encryption mechanism where user identities act as public keys, improving security without complex key management.
Tools and Technologies Used:
Blockchain Framework (Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum for permissioned blockchain)
Python (for cryptographic algorithm implementation)
Cryptographic Libraries (PyCryptodome, OpenSSL)
Smart Contracts (Solidity for Ethereum-based blockchain)
SQL/NoSQL Databases (for encrypted data storage)
Machine Learning (optional) (if used for anomaly detection in security)
